### Proposed Space Tug of 1970, 1971

Wikipedia has an overview of the proposed [space tug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tug). If you do some searching there are a few other sites that are a good deal more exhaustive in covering the space tug. If you dig further still there are a number of NASA documents from the early 1970's that also go into great depth on the proposed tug spacecraft including early work done by Rockwell and Boeing.

In short the space tug was to be a modular work horse of space construction as well as satellite deployment and repair. The modular nature of the design allowed it to even be used as a lunar lander. In fact, a good deal of the utility of the space tug appeared to have bein in lunar orbit and in support of lunar activities.

There were a couple of different space tug designs. The one I attempted to model in 3D was the rather plain cylindrical version that is depicted in a number of NASA concept art pieces of the era.

I included the following graphic because it shows a timeline for space exploration as envisioned in 1970. I confess that when I was young I bought into that proposal and was sorely disappointed when it did not come to pass. There's no doubt that this is why I am turning to recreating this fascinating era in 3D models.

I proposed to create the digital 3D model of the space tug in Blender and the print it in resin on a 3D printer. Because this model was to have an interior visible through thr windows, there was no question that it was going to be printed in sperate pieces. It would be impossible to paint the interior otherwise.

So the first work was to experiment with breaking the space tug model into both an interior and exterior model.

</p>

The above image shows the iterations experimenting with scale, wall thickness, and component break down. You can see near the bottom of the image what would come out of these experiments: a central "washing-machine-like agitator" for the interior and a cylindrical exterior with three vertical guides to accept the three interior walls.

The floor would be integrated into the interior and the whole interior slid up from below. At this point I knew a ceiling would be another separate component. As I continued work on the space tug, many more parts would be added.
