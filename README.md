### Proposed Space Tug of 1970, 1971

Wikipedia has an overview of the proposed [space tug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tug). If you do some searching there are a few other sites that are a good deal more exhaustive in covering the space tug. If you dig further still there are a number of NASA documents from the early 1970's that also go into great depth on the proposed tug spacecraft including early work done by Rockwell and Boeing.

In short the space tug was to be a modular work horse of space construction as well as satellite deployment and repair. The modular nature of the design allowed it to even be used as a lunar lander. In fact, a good deal of the utility of the space tug appeared to have bein in lunar orbit and in support of lunar activities.

There were a couple of different space tug designs. The one I attempted to model in 3D was the rather plain cylindrical version that is depicted in a number of NASA concept art pieces of the era.

I included the following graphic because it shows a timeline for space exploration as envisioned in 1970. I confess that when I was young I bought into that proposal and was sorely disappointed when it did not come to pass. There's no doubt that this is why I am turning to recreating this fascinating era in 3D models.

### 3D Model

<p align="center">

</p>

I proposed to create the digital 3D model of the space tug in Blender and the print it in resin on a 3D printer. Because this model was to have an interior visible through thr windows, there was no question that it was going to be printed in sperate pieces. It would be impossible to paint the interior otherwise.

So the first work was to experiment with breaking the space tug model into both an interior and exterior model.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/933a54f30375e6010726e80861a590a87b3d2bd4/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Early%20Work.jpeg" alt="Early iterations to determine scale and breakdown.">
</p>

The above image shows the iterations experimenting with scale, wall thickness, and component break down. You can see near the bottom of the image what would come out of these experiments: a central "washing-machine-like agitator" for the interior and a cylindrical exterior with three vertical guides to accept the three interior walls.

The floor would be integrated into the interior and the whole interior slid up from below. At this point I knew a ceiling would be another separate component. As I continued work on the space tug, many more parts would be added.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/4ef9216ba9387edd4d38d24cf503873339ccc32f/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Main%20Interior.jpeg" alt="Space tug interior.">
</p>

After a number of iterations (as usual), the interior began to take on the shape above. Although probably not visible, I was intent to make the floor resemble that of Sky Lab - suggesting a lattice that allows specially designed shoes to lock in place anchoring the astronauts when they desire it.

I knew I wanted a central column that would represent a kind of airlock as well as being the means of moving between the space tug and a docked vehicle or space station. A large hatch then was modelled to sit more or less in the center of the central cylinder.

Two equipment closets were added. I had hoped to add some equipment, like a space suit for example, but my modelling skills were not up to it.

Finally a number of displays were added radially around the central cylinder suggesting control panels or computer interfaces.

A lot more detail could be added as I expect the interior to be the most detail-rich aspect of the space tug. But I stopped at this point due to a degree of laziness and the fact that you would not be able to see much of the interior when the model was completed.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/adb1073506a09537cfe099f48a5ebde8da391181/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Main%20Exterior.jpeg" alt="Space tug exterior component.">
</p>

The largest component is of course the exterior of the space tug as shown above.

Radiator-like fluting for the anti-glare panel beneath the window as well as around the lower circumference of the exterior were important visual elements that borrow from elements of contemporary spacecraft of the time: notably the Saturn V rocket.

The windows angle downward as depicted in many of the artist's concepts of the era. Likely to allow greater visibility for objects just below the astronauts. Two recessed lights are scooped out to the left and right of the windows.

A large cutout is left just below the windows - this is for the part of the model I call the *arm box*. You will see this part later.

Walls are reinforced around the interior of the part with the additional grooves that allow the interior walls to slot in place. A lip around the top interior circumference will seat the "roof" part.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/dce04861a5cef8d03a4c85f8b9c44e6e0fc769e9/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Arm%20Box.jpeg" alt="Space tug arm box.">
</p>

Most of the artwork of the era show the manipulator arms of the space tug just hanging out, attached somewhere to the exterior of the spacecraft. Instead I wanted an area where the arms could be *stowed*. So perhaps in a nod to R2-D2, I designed the arms to fold more or less flush into an "arm box" below the windows. This would correspond to an interior volume just in front of the standing astronauts knees.

Making this a separate part makes it a good deal easier to paint.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/dce04861a5cef8d03a4c85f8b9c44e6e0fc769e9/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Arms.jpeg" alt="Space tug arms">
</p>

The arms are broken down into four parts each - there being both a port and a starboard arm means eight parts in total. In this way the arms are "posable". My method of connecting the parts leaves a lot to be desired so I soon found it made more sense to glue the arms in whatever position the modeller envisions. In fact, by printing additional arms parts, the modeller can position a pair of arms *stowed* and a pair of arms *manipulating* and swap between the two.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/dce04861a5cef8d03a4c85f8b9c44e6e0fc769e9/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Arms%20One%20Piece.jpeg" alt="Space tug arms printed as one-piece">
</p>

I experimented with 3D printing the stowed arms as a single piece each to make it unneccesary to glue the four parts together for each arm. This might make sense for the manipulating arm poses as well. The photo above shows the arms fresh out of the printer - the supports and base still attached.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/54c74b945e894f50eca5a36db999b250b19f4924/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Exterior%20Floor.jpeg" alt="Exterior floor of Space Tug.">
</p>

When printing in 3D you may be aware that supports generally have to be added so that the process of extruding the part can be accomplished. This often has the unfortunate effect of leaving blemishes on the supported side of the part. For this reason, even though there is a floor in the interior of my space tug model, I elected to print as a seperate piece the part that woudl represent the exterior "floor" of the hull.

Fluting was added to imply reinforcing ribs for structural integrity — also a detail lifted from contemporary spacecraft of the 1970's.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/54c74b945e894f50eca5a36db999b250b19f4924/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Ceiling.jpeg" alt="Space tug interior ceiling.">
</p>

Following the same pattern, I modelled a seperate part to represent the interior ceiling of the space tug and, as you will see below, another part that is for the exterior roof of the hull.

Again, like the main interior part, more detail could certainly be added. Instead I contented myself with the two windows (for use when docking) some support ribs, and a couple of extrusions that were to represent more displays or spacecraft controls. As you'll see I ultimately ended up slipping some lighting hardware in these extrusions.

<p align="center">

</p>

And then there is the "roof" of the space tug — shown above after I had begun to paint it. Corresponding windows for docking and the central gole for the access tunnel are the primary features. Also, as suggested in some of NASA's artist's concepts, ribbed rings and spokes suggest structural reinforcing.

<p align="center">

</p>

The last component of the space tug I modelled are the four, small reaction control thrusters (RCS, or reaction control system). One is shown above prior to detailing. Four of these attach around the exterior body of the space tug in a radial fashion.
