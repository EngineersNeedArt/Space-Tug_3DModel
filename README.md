Iterations of the Vela model.

This is a simple model of the Vela satellite I created using the [Blender](https://www.blender.org) software. I have included the files I used to create the model in this repo.

The model was created to be printed at a fairly small scale. It lacks detail for a larger print — was meant as a prop for my Space Tug model that I also created in Blender (the Space Tug has manipulator arms and I wanted something for them to manipulate).

I chose the Vela satellite in part because of its size relative to the Space Tug — I didn't want the satellite to dwarf the Space Tug nor be dwarfed. Also, the Vela was more or less of the same era as the proposed (1970) Space Tug.

### Proposed Space Tug of 1970, 1971

Wikipedia has an overview of the proposed [space tug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tug). If you do some searching there are a few other sites that are a good deal more exhaustive in covering the space tug. If you dig further still there are a number of NASA documents from the early 1970's that also go into great depth on the proposed tug spacecraft including early work done by Rockwell and Boeing.

In short the space tug was to be a modular work horse of space construction as well as satellite deployment and repair. The modular nature of the design allowed it to even be used as a lunar lander. In fact, a good deal of the utility of the space tug appeared to have bein in lunar orbit and in support of lunar activities.

There were a couple of different space tug designs. The one I attempted to model in 3D was the rather plain cylindrical version that is depicted in a number of NASA concept art pieces of the era.
