</p>

The space tug was a proposed space craft from around 1970, 1971. If you checked out library books about space flight from that decade you would often see artist's concepts of the space tug. It was thought that the coming age of space exploration would require a kind of work horse to assemble space stations, launch and repair artificial satellites, ferry crew between space craft and space stations, etc.

I had always been fascinated by this little utilitarian vehicle, always disappointed there was never a plastic model kit made of it.

When I got older I attempted a few times to scratch-build a model using the techniques used to create model spacecraft for Hollywood movies.

</p>

At some point I decided to have a go at using Blender to model the space tug and a 3D resin printer to produce a physical representation of my model. It was of course a means to satisfy a decades old itch I had had since I was young — but too it was a way to learn the limits of both Blender and resin printing.

### The Files

I have included all the files needed to create my model of the 1970's-era Space Tug.

The files I have included are a mix of Blender files and STL files. The Blender files contain all the parts (at least a dozen) for the space tug. There is not a one-to-one correlation between the Blender files and the parts as some of the Blender files contain multiple objects.

The STL files I included could perhaps be directly imported into your favorite slicer application but I included them more as a kind of preview of each part. 

Here I list the Blender files and what parts they contain:

  * SpaceTug_Armbox.blend

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Contains just the arm-box. Export and print.*

  * SpaceTug_Arms.blend

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Some arms retracted, some extended, arm parts. Ignore arm boxes — they’re to aid in positioning arms.*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*You can export the individual arm pieces and then assemble them or export an entire posed arm and print that.*

  * SpaceTug_Bottom.blend

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Contains both the bottom of the space tug and an airlock hatch. Export and print both pieces.*

  * SpaceTug_Ceiling.blend

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Contains the ceiling piece. Export and print.*

  * SpaceTug_Exterior.blend

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Contains the tug exterior and a pair of RCS objects (one larger). Export and print exterior and four of the RCS objects.*

  * SpaceTug_Interior.blend

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Contains the space tug interior. Export and print.*

  * SpaceTug_Stand.blend

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Optional stand for the space tug. Export and print if you like.*

  * SpaceTug_Top.blend

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Contains the top of the space tug. Export and print.*

### Printing

Scale, as far as I know, is not solved with 3D prints. It seems regardless of the scale I specify in the Blender files, the exported STL files, when brought into a slicer application, are some other scale. They are consistent between the parts and files I have included here though. So if you scale an object exported from one Blender file and print it, another object from another file, scaled the same amount, will print at a size compatible with the first object.

The scale I chose for my space tug is about 1/48 scale. Since the space tug was never actually built, I could kind of make up whatever size I wanted for it. I noted that the Space Shuttle could accommodate a cylindrical payload with a maximum of 4.6 meters in diameter. I think therefore I chose something like 4.5 meters or about 15 feet for the diameter of my space tug.

At 1/48 scale the resulting model would have a diameter of about 93 millimeters. When I pull the exterior STL object into the CHITUBOX slicer, I determined I needed to scale it up 2083.33%. It is an odd amount, and not critical. But whatever scale you choose, use that for all other parts that you print to maintain the same relative scale.

By the way, having chosen the 1/48 scale meant I needed a larger resin printer than the one I had at the time. Oh well.

Also, by the way, choosing a scale ended up solving some other issues down the road — for example, how much detail is *enough* detail. Given the final size of the model and resolution of the 3D printer, it became clear when I was adding detail too small to be resolved by the printer. (In fact, for the small RCS rockets I ended up scaling them up just so they could be printed.)

If you have a printer capable of printing larger, you could scale the model up. You may find however that at larger scales expected detail is lacking.

Finally, I did not have any appropriate "shirt sleeve" astronauts for my space tug. Searching around the internet I did find a woman with a camera and a standing man that I scaled to about 1/48. Since they were not my creation I have not included them here. I wish I had the skill to model people and could have included astronauts.

### Proposed Space Tug of 1970, 1971

Wikipedia has an overview of the proposed [space tug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tug). If you do some searching there are a few other sites that are a good deal more exhaustive in covering the space tug. If you dig further still there are a number of NASA documents from the early 1970's that also go into great depth on the proposed tug spacecraft including early work done by Rockwell and Boeing.

In short the space tug was to be a modular work horse of space construction as well as satellite deployment and repair. The modular nature of the design allowed it to even be used as a lunar lander. In fact, a good deal of the utility of the space tug appeared to have been in lunar orbit and in support of lunar activities.

There were a couple of different space tug designs. The one I attempted to model in 3D was the rather plain cylindrical version that is depicted in a number of NASA concept art pieces of the era.

I included the following graphic because it shows a timeline for space exploration as envisioned in 1970. I confess that when I was young I bought into that proposal and was sorely disappointed when it did not come to pass. There's no doubt that this is why I am turning to recreating this fascinating era in 3D models.

### 3D Model

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/af153a33e2a5dde09685f580a526e8b8f8d8321e/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Iterations.jpeg" alt="Space tug iterations">
</p>

I proposed to create the digital 3D model of the space tug in Blender and the print it in resin on a 3D printer. Because this model was to have an interior visible through the windows, there was no question that it was going to be printed in separate pieces. It would be impossible to paint the interior otherwise.

So the first work was to experiment with breaking the space tug model into both an interior and exterior model.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/933a54f30375e6010726e80861a590a87b3d2bd4/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Early%20Work.jpeg" alt="Early iterations to determine scale and breakdown.">
</p>

The above image shows the iterations experimenting with scale, wall thickness, and component break down. You can see near the bottom of the image what would come out of these experiments: a central "washing-machine-like agitator" for the interior and a cylindrical exterior with three vertical guides to accept the three interior walls.

The floor would be integrated into the interior and the whole interior slid up from below. At this point I knew a ceiling would be another separate component. As I continued work on the space tug, many more parts would be added.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/4ef9216ba9387edd4d38d24cf503873339ccc32f/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Main%20Interior.jpeg" alt="Space tug interior.">
</p>

After a number of iterations (as usual), the interior began to take on the shape above. Although probably not visible, I was intent to make the floor resemble that of Sky Lab - suggesting a lattice that allows specially designed shoes to lock in place anchoring the astronauts when they desire it.

I knew I wanted a central column that would represent a kind of airlock as well as being the means of moving between the space tug and a docked vehicle or space station. A large hatch then was modeled to sit more or less in the center of the central cylinder.

Two equipment closets were added. I had hoped to add some equipment, like a space suit for example, but my modeling skills were not up to it.

Finally a number of displays were added radially around the central cylinder suggesting control panels or computer interfaces.

A lot more detail could be added as I expect the interior to be the most detail-rich aspect of the space tug. But I stopped at this point due to a degree of laziness and the fact that you would not be able to see much of the interior when the model was completed.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/adb1073506a09537cfe099f48a5ebde8da391181/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Main%20Exterior.jpeg" alt="Space tug exterior component.">
</p>

The largest component is of course the exterior of the space tug as shown above.

Radiator-like fluting for the anti-glare panel beneath the window as well as around the lower circumference of the exterior were important visual elements that borrow from elements of contemporary spacecraft of the time: notably the Saturn V rocket.

The windows angle downward as depicted in many of the artist's concepts of the era. Likely to allow greater visibility for objects just below the astronauts. Two recessed lights are scooped out to the left and right of the windows.

A large cutout is left just below the windows - this is for the part of the model I call the *arm box*. You will see this part later.

Walls are reinforced around the interior of the part with the additional grooves that allow the interior walls to slot in place. A lip around the top interior circumference will seat the "roof" part.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/dce04861a5cef8d03a4c85f8b9c44e6e0fc769e9/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Arm%20Box.jpeg" alt="Space tug arm box.">
</p>

Most of the artwork of the era show the manipulator arms of the space tug just hanging out, attached somewhere to the exterior of the spacecraft. Instead I wanted an area where the arms could be *stowed*. So perhaps in a nod to R2-D2, I designed the arms to fold more or less flush into an "arm box" below the windows. This would correspond to an interior volume just in front of the standing astronauts knees.

Making this a separate part makes it a good deal easier to paint.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/dce04861a5cef8d03a4c85f8b9c44e6e0fc769e9/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Arms.jpeg" alt="Space tug arms">
</p>

The arms are broken down into four parts each - there being both a port and a starboard arm means eight parts in total. In this way the arms are "posable". My method of connecting the parts leaves a lot to be desired so I soon found it made more sense to glue the arms in whatever position the modeler envisions. In fact by printing additional arms parts the modeler can position a pair of arms *stowed* and a pair of arms *manipulating* and swap between the two.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/dce04861a5cef8d03a4c85f8b9c44e6e0fc769e9/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Arms%20One%20Piece.jpeg" alt="Space tug arms printed as one-piece">
</p>

I experimented with 3D printing the stowed arms as a single piece each to make it unnecessary to glue the four parts together for each arm. This might make sense for the manipulating arm poses as well. The photo above shows the arms fresh out of the printer - the supports and base still attached.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/54c74b945e894f50eca5a36db999b250b19f4924/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Exterior%20Floor.jpeg" alt="Exterior floor of Space Tug.">
</p>

When printing in 3D you may be aware that supports generally have to be added so that the process of extruding the part can be accomplished. This often has the unfortunate effect of leaving blemishes on the supported side of the part. For this reason, even though there is a floor in the interior of my space tug model, I elected to print as a separate piece the part that would represent the exterior "floor" of the hull.

Fluting was added to imply reinforcing ribs for structural integrity — also a detail lifted from contemporary spacecraft of the 1970's.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/54c74b945e894f50eca5a36db999b250b19f4924/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Ceiling.jpeg" alt="Space tug interior ceiling.">
</p>

Following the same pattern, I modeled a separate part to represent the interior ceiling of the space tug and, as you will see below, another part that is for the exterior roof of the hull.

Again, like the main interior part, more detail could certainly be added. Instead I contented myself with the two windows (for use when docking) some support ribs, and a couple of extrusions that were to represent more displays or spacecraft controls. As you'll see I ultimately ended up slipping some lighting hardware in these extrusions.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/54c74b945e894f50eca5a36db999b250b19f4924/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Exterior%20Roof.jpeg" alt="Exterior roof of the space tug">
</p>

And then there is the "roof" of the space tug — shown above after I had begun to paint it. Corresponding windows for docking and the central hole for the access tunnel are the primary features. Also, as suggested in some of NASA's artist's concepts, ribbed rings and spokes suggest structural reinforcing.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/54c74b945e894f50eca5a36db999b250b19f4924/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20RCS.jpeg" alt="Space tug RCS module.">
</p>

The last component of the space tug I modeled are the four, small reaction control thrusters (RCS, or reaction control system). One is shown above prior to detailing. Four of these attach around the exterior body of the space tug in a radial fashion.

### Painting 

I made models when I was young but I did not have the patience, the temperament, or the financial means to progress beyond gluing the parts together and then hitting the model with paint from a spray can. I would not have been able to afford an airbrush at the time, and then when I was older and finally able to afford one, I found I was a little intimidated by what I perceived as a difficult to master tool.

Fortunately we have YouTube now and there are plenty of very good modelers happy to share their techniques. Fortunate too that the iterative approach to creating the space tug afforded me plenty of space tug prototypes that allowed me to experiment with different painting techniques.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/5c82c8ddf437002ab1437e015ddbee9b2c240bea/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Interior%20Masking.jpeg" alt="Masking the interior.">
</p>

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/45f630c1ac196458da773cc210bff05612c54656/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Interior%20Painting.jpeg" alt="Painting the interior.">
</p>

As an example, in one iteration of painting the interior, I decided to go with a zinc chromate color (almost a kind of primer in aerospace). In the above photo you can see the use of masks cut from vinyl, masking tape, and even the trick of using Silly Putty to mask irregular surfaces.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/5c82c8ddf437002ab1437e015ddbee9b2c240bea/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Interior%20Painted.jpeg" alt="Painted interior.">
</p>

In fact I was not very happy with the color scheme but I learned a bit about some masking techniques.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/5c82c8ddf437002ab1437e015ddbee9b2c240bea/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Exterior%20Masking.jpeg" alt="Masking the exterior.">
</p>

Masking the exterior of the space tug model was much more straight forward and could be done with simple masking tape.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/5c82c8ddf437002ab1437e015ddbee9b2c240bea/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Exterior%20Bright%20Color.jpeg" alt="Bright colors on the exterior.">
</p>

A trick I wanted to experiment with involves painting the panels of the model rather vivid colors. But then using successive coats of gray paint form the air brush to keep toning the colors down. This gives you a kind of under-color and adds some variety and "color temperature" to the otherwise plain panels of the exterior.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/5c82c8ddf437002ab1437e015ddbee9b2c240bea/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Exterior%20Tone%20Down%201.jpeg" alt="Colors being toned down on the exterior.">

</p>

Maybe the red was too much. But in fact I ended up painting most of the red areas a very dark grey anyway.

<p align="center">

</p>

I used a vinyl cutter to create masks for a variety of purposes. The number "3" on the side of the Space Tug was done with a vinyl mask.

</p>

### Lighting

It was important to me that there be some lighting of the model. At the very least I wanted some sort of work light similar to the space pods from "2001: A Space Odyssey". As you saw in the model above I carved out two exterior recesses - one on each side of the window - intended for lights to be installed.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/5e52b191e44e4e5badc3420985ed57513f48c813/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Kristal%20Klear.jpeg" alt="Kristal Klear for windows.">
</p>

There is a product in modeling called Kristal Klear. While I purchased a bottle of it for the Space Tug, I am convinced it is nothing more than PVA glue. In any event, its utility is that it dries clear — and so I experimented with creating small drops of Kristal Klear on waxed paper in order to create small lended for the two work lights on the exterior of the Space Tug.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/5e52b191e44e4e5badc3420985ed57513f48c813/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Work%20Light.jpeg" alt="Work light with Kristal Klear lens.">
</p>

Very small LEDs can be purchased in a variety of colors. For each work light, I installed a small warm-white LED with the wires running into the space tug interior. First, a small drop of Kristal Klear was added to fill the empty space within the recess around the LED and then a Kristal Klear "lens" was selected and glued on top.

I have mixed feelings about the result. I wish in fact you could not see the LED. This is not an issue however when the LEDs are lit up.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/5e52b191e44e4e5badc3420985ed57513f48c813/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Ceiling%20LEDs2.jpeg" alt="LEDs installed in ceiling recesses.">
</p>

Foe cabin lighting I had added the two protrusions in the ceiling for just such a purpose. I liked the red interior lighting I had seen in a few 1970's artist's concepts of the space tug (Robert McCall, for example) and it also reminded me of a few scenes again from "2001: A Space Odyssey". I thought also that a warm white light might be interesting so I installed both colors of LEDs on separate circuits.

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/5e52b191e44e4e5badc3420985ed57513f48c813/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Ceilng%20LEDs.jpeg" alt="Kristal Klear again used.">
</p>

Again Kristal Klear was poured over the LEDs, filling the void. (And I had decided against the zinc chromate color for the ceiling and hit it with grey before the above photo was taken.)

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModel/blob/5e52b191e44e4e5badc3420985ed57513f48c813/print_images/Space%20Tug%20-%20Wiring.jpeg" alt="Internal wiring.">
</p>

The wiring for the six LEDs was brought together and a connector run into the central access cylinder. One circuit would power the red LEDs plus the external work lights while another circuit would power just the interior warm white lights.
